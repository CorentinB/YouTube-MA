# YouTube-MA
ðŸ’¾ Light and fast YouTube metadata archiver written in Golang

# Usage

First download the latest release from https://github.com/CorentinB/youtube-ma/releases
Make it executable with:
```
chmod +x youtube-ma
```

Then here is an example of usage with a single ID:
```
./youtube-ma MPBfVp0tB8E
```
But you can also use a list of IDs, be carefull to have an ID per line, no complete URL.
```
./youtube-ma my_list.txt 32
```
Here **32** is the number of goroutines maximum that can be run at the same time, it'll depend on your system, as it's also linked to a certain number of files opened at the same time, that could be limited by your system's configuration. If you want to use a bigger value, tweak your system, such as **ulimit**.
Default for this value if you don't precise any value is **16**, should be safe in most system.
